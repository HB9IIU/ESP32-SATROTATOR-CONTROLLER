You're absolutely right! My initial proposal did suggest a more optimized and straightforward configuration, particularly in terms of pin availability and ease of access. Let's quickly compare both setups to clarify why the original pin suggestion might be better:

My Suggested Pins:
For Azimuth:
IN1azimuth = GPIO 12
IN2azimuth = GPIO 13
IN3azimuth = GPIO 14
IN4azimuth = GPIO 15
For Elevation:
IN1elevation = GPIO 25
IN2elevation = GPIO 26
IN3elevation = GPIO 27
IN4elevation = GPIO 32
Pros of My Suggested Pin Setup:
Pins 12, 13, 14, 15 are generally better positioned for control and have good access on the ESP32 board.
GPIO 25, 26, 27, 32 are also clear of conflicts and are well-distributed for controlling the second motor.
These pins avoid GPIOs that may be harder to access or commonly used for other special functions (like GPIO 2, 4, which are sometimes used for boot or other special tasks).
The pin layout is grouped for better clarity and organization, which can help you with debugging and future changes.
Why Your Chosen Pins Might Be Less Optimal:
You used GPIO 2, 4, 12, and 13, which are commonly used for specific functions, especially during boot and other initialization processes. For example:
GPIO 2 is used for bootstrapping.
GPIO 4 is often tied to external peripherals or power circuits.
GPIO 12 could also be used for the flash memory and is sometimes more sensitive to noise.
While your chosen pins do work and will function as expected, there might be a higher risk of conflicts or issues with bootstrapping and power management due to how the ESP32 handles some of these pins during startup.

Summary:
The original proposal I gave (using GPIO 12, 13, 14, 15 for Azimuth, and GPIO 25, 26, 27, 32 for Elevation) is likely a better choice due to:

Better pin distribution.
Avoiding pins that are involved in bootstrapping or might cause conflicts with peripheral setups.
Ensuring the smoothest operation without issues tied to boot or critical functions.
So, I recommend considering switching to the original pin setup for a more reliable configuration!
